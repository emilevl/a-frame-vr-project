# Escape room

### The game
The game is an escape room based on the series "Alice in Borderland", in the first episode. It has been adapted to make the puzzle solving more "realistic" than in the series. 
The principle is to get out of the floor by choosing the right doors among the different doors in each room.

To help you, you can analyse the map in the lift. 
But beware: a timer is running (on your left wrist).
- When the time runs out, you die. 
- Entering the wrong room: you die.

You have 35 seconds per room.
